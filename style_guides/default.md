# Default Markdown Style Guide

## Overview
This style guide provides general guidelines for writing clear, consistent, and professional markdown content.

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Write in a clear, professional tone
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid jargon unless necessary and always define technical terms

### Grammar and Style
- Use title case for all headings (e.g. This Is Title Case)
- Spell out numbers under 10, use numerals for 10 and above
- Use the Oxford comma in lists
- Write in present tense when possible
- Use contractions sparingly in formal content

## Formatting Standards

### Headers
- Use `#` for the main title (only one per document)
- Use `##` for major sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Never skip header levels (don't go from `#` to `###`)
- Add blank lines before and after headers

### Lists
- Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists
- Use numbers (`1.`) for sequential or ranked items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Use consistent punctuation within lists
- Add blank lines between list items if they are long or complex

### Code and Technical Content
- Use backticks for inline code: `code`
- Use code blocks with language specification for multi-line code:
  ```python
  def example():
      return "formatted code"
  ```
- Always specify the programming language for syntax highlighting
- Keep code examples concise and relevant

### Links and References
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here" or URLs
- Format: `[descriptive text](URL)`
- For references to other sections, use relative links when possible

### Emphasis
- Use **bold** for important terms and strong emphasis
- Use *italics* for subtle emphasis and foreign words
- Don't overuse emphasis - it loses impact

### Tables
- Always include headers
- Align columns consistently
- Keep table content concise
- Use tables only when they improve readability

### Images
- Always include alt text: `![alt text](image-url)`
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Keep images relevant and appropriately sized

## Content Structure

### Document Organization
- Start with a clear title
- Include a brief introduction or overview
- Use logical section progression
- End with conclusion or next steps when appropriate

### Paragraph Guidelines
- Keep paragraphs focused on one main idea
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph
- Use transition words to connect ideas
- Break up long blocks of text with subheadings

### Examples and Illustrations
- Include relevant examples to clarify complex concepts
- Use consistent formatting for examples
- Clearly label examples as such

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing content, ensure:
- [ ] All headers follow the hierarchy rules
- [ ] Lists are formatted consistently
- [ ] Code blocks have language specifications
- [ ] Links work and have descriptive text
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
- [ ] Content flows logically from section to section
- [ ] Technical terms are defined when first used
- [ ] The document serves its intended purpose

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't use multiple consecutive blank lines
- Don't mix bullet styles in the same list
- Don't use headers for emphasis (use **bold** instead)
- Don't forget to preview your formatted markdown
- Don't use tables for simple lists
- Don't overuse block quotes - save them for actual quotations
